# Fingerprint model configuration for robustness testing
# This config defines the frozen model to use for all experiments

model:
  # Model type: "mert", "muq", "openl3", or path to custom model
  type: "mert"
  name: "m-a-p/MERT-v1-330M"  # HuggingFace model identifier
  path: null  # If using custom model, specify path here
  
  # Model checksum for verification (sha256)
  # Update this after freezing the model
  checksum: null
  
  # Device: "cuda", "cpu", or null for auto-detect
  device: null

# Audio processing parameters
audio:
  sample_rate: 44100
  segment_length: 0.5  # seconds
  hop_length: null  # null = no overlap, segment_length = hop_length
  mono: true
  normalization: "peak"  # "peak", "rms", or null

# Embedding parameters
embedding:
  dimension: 512  # Expected output dimension
  normalization: "l2"  # "l2", "none"
  dtype: "float32"

# Segment processing
segmentation:
  method: "fixed_length"  # "fixed_length", "overlapping"
  overlap_ratio: 0.0  # 0.0 = no overlap, 0.5 = 50% overlap

# Metadata
metadata:
  version: "v1"
  created_date: null  # Set when model is frozen
